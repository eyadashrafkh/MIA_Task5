### Task 6 <a name="Task6"></a>

Branch Name: [Task6](../../tree/Task6)

Description: Designing 2 Arduino codes, one that Interface with the famous and cheap IMU sensor MPU6050, and retrieve the Yaw angle which angle along the z-axis (Itâ€™s preferred to interface with the sensor register, and the other interface with rotary Encoder and get the number of counts from the train of impulse from A, and B signals.
Answering 2 questions about each codes and its components.
Write article about Path planning using LaTeX.

Insights: Learned about sensors and its functionality also the rotary encoder and LaTeX language.

Return [main branch](../../tree/main)
