**Q: If the Sensor is surrounded by a noisy environment, what type of filter could be used and what is the recommended cutoff frequency depending on the sensor MPU6050 datasheet?**

The MPU6050 datasheet recommends using a low-pass filter to reduce high-frequency noise. The low-pass filter is implemented within the sensor itself and can be configured to attenuate frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency.

According to the MPU6050 datasheet, the recommended cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter can be set to one of the following values: 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 42 Hz, 98 Hz, or 188 Hz. The specific cutoff frequency to use depends on the requirements of your application.

To select the appropriate cutoff frequency, consider the following factors:
1. The nature and frequency content of the noise in the environment.
2. The desired trade-off between noise reduction and responsiveness to changes in motion.
3. The bandwidth of the motion you are interested in capturing accurately.
